EXTRA CREDIT: New Wave
After the player kills all the aliens, they are given the
option to continue and if they press "c" a new wave of aliens is created,
but the player's lives and score remains the same. The aliens start from the
initial starting position, in other words, the new wave of aliens does not
continue from the point that they were all killed off.

EXTRA CREDIT: Score
Every time a player kills an alien the player is awarded
some amount of points. The point value associated with each alien
increases based on the row they are in so the aliens higher up will be
valued more than the aliens at the bottom. The player's score remains the same
when they continue are losing a life.

EXTRA CREDIT: Sound
When the ship shoots, it makes the pew noise. When the alien shoots, it makes
the blast noise. When the alien is killed, it makes the pop noise. When the ship
explodes, it makes a different blast noise. If you want to make our game even
more fun, I would set all the sound attributes to 'blast3.wav', increase your
volume to max, and enjoy the noises haha.
